# NVIDIA ROS DEV Container 

Small repo to hold a dev container for a ROS Noetic NVidia ros. 

Works with VS Code Dev Containers Remote Extension. 

Run `allow_x11.sh` to enable access to your x11 session by the container. 

After this you should be able to run ROS graphical tools like rqt and rviz
